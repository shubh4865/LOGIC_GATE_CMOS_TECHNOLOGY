Design, layout of logic gates using electric tool and LT-Spice

Project Description:
The project focuses on the design, layout, and analysis of logic gates using the Electric tool and LT-Spice software. The primary goal is to design standard cells for a 2-input NOR gate and a 2-input NAND gate, optimize their performance in terms of propagation delay and power consumption, and verify their functionality through simulations.

Design and Schematic: The project involves the creation of schematics for the 2-input NOR and NAND gates. The sizing of NMOS and PMOS transistors is adjusted to achieve equal rise and fall times, ensuring efficient switching behavior.

Layout Design: Layouts for both the NOR and NAND gates were created, followed by Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) verification to ensure correctness.

Propagation Delay Analysis: Propagation delays were measured for different load capacitances (5 fF and 50 fF) for both the schematic and layout designs. The delays were recorded and compared to assess the circuit's speed performance.

Power Consumption: Power consumption was analyzed for both the schematic and layout designs at different load capacitances, providing insights into the circuit's efficiency.

Waveform Analysis: Input and output waveforms were generated using LT-Spice, showing the response of the gates under different conditions. This validated the logic gates' performance and functionality.

Overall, the project successfully demonstrates the design, layout, and analysis of fundamental logic gates using VLSI tools, ensuring that the gates meet required performance criteria in terms of propagation delay and power consumption.
